    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <h3>Section Tag</h3>
    <section>The section HTML element represents a generic standalone section of a document, which doesn't have a more
        specific semantic element to represent it. Sections should always have a heading, with very few exceptions.

    </section>
    <h3>Article Tag</h3>
    <article>The article tag specifies independent, self-contained content.

        An article should make sense on its own and it should be possible to distribute it independently from the rest
        of the site.

        Potential sources for the article element:
    </article>
    <h3>Aside Tag</h3>
    <aside>The aside tag defines some content aside from the content it is placed in.

        The aside content should be indirectly related to the surrounding content.
    </aside>
    <h3>Figure Tag</h3>
    <figure>The figure tag specifies self-contained content, like illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc.
        While the content of the figure element is related to the main flow, its position is independent of the main
        flow, and if removed it should not affect the flow of the document.
    </figure>
